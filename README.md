# Darscripts

A collection of useful scripts that I made overtime to solve my own problems.
**Note:** It is still in development, almost nothing is finished yet, just merging, which was the first thing to be implemented.

## Installation

You need python 3.10+ to be able to run the project correctly, this is mostly fault of using match states in python, but I wanted to use it, if the project really needs to downgrade for compatibility I'll just commit a change.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SirenityK/scripts
```

This will install the project in the PATH, so you will now be able to use these tools.

## Usage

By just executing the script:

```bash
darscripts
```

You will see a menu where you will be able to select an option.

## FAQ

### Why is this called darscripts?

- Because thats an abbreviation for my name, I don't really like it, but I think I need to develop some creativity first.

### Is this really necessary?

- Nowadays there are tools everywhere to do all kinds of stuff, [ILovePDF](https://www.ilovepdf.com/) for example does this job better than this project (for now I hope), but there's a risk of privacy. Wi-Fi connection is needed too. Not very useful for very large files or hundreds of files.
- Adobe Acrobat can work on pdf and OCR flawlessly, but it is limited due to it being a paid application, and not many people are able to crack it and is illegal tho. This little tool is proven to be a lot faster in the simple tools of merging, encrypting, etc. and can even run on slower devices, also without requiring a gigabyte of space to install Acrobat.
- Work with PDF and do OCR on text may be a computer-only task, for instance: to run it locally, you need Acrobat, which is only on windows, which means pc-only. This tool runs perfectly on android devices (with termux or a mobile python interpreter), which also makes it useful for a random moment when I might need it in life.
